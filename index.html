    <h3>Pilot gameplay</h3>
       <p> Pilot gameplay follows the same basic lines as the first game, in regards to basic mechanics. <br> 
        However, the health of players has been drastically lowered, and Time-To-Kill (TTK) is much lower than the first, making fast reflexes more of a priority.

    <h3>Titans</h3>
<p>Titans have had a significant gameplay change since the first game. Instead of fully-customisable loadouts like those of Pilots, Titans are now based on six class archetypes (Seven, as of Monarch's Reign). <br> These archetypes each have a unique class weapon, tactical/ utility ability, Core Ability, Ordnance and defensive ability. <br> In addition, Electric Smoke - a defensive ability selectable in lieu of another in Titanfall - is now a standard ability available to all Titans. <br>
Titan customization is not completely gone, as players can still select three Titan Kits, one universal, one unique to that Titan class and one that affects how the Titan drops into battle. <br> These allow a player to emphasize or optimize a certain playstyle within their class. <br> For example, a player playing Ion could optimise their class towards the Laser Shot as their primary tool by using Entangled Energy to constantly replenish their shot. Alternatively, they could emphasize their Vortex Shield via Vortex Amplifier, Laser Core via Grand Cannon or Splitter Rifle via Refraction Lens. <br> The only exception to this is the Monarch, which can choose three tiers of upgrades to use in its upgrade core; a full explanation of this mechanic can be found here.</p>
